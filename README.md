**Numpad Trainer**

**Summary**:
Intended to improve one's typing speed on the numpad, this WPF application flashes numbers across the screen and only accepts numpad inputs.
With built in stats to track chains of correct/incorrect answers, most commonly messed up entries and etc.

Also contains minor settings configurations and reset capabilities

Very basic, very poorly organised and probably impossible to get running. One of my first ever projects which I committed to and saw to the end
(thouh I made no commits as I had no idea what Version Control or Git was, sorry)

**Installation**:
To be honest, I couldn't tell you how to run this. I made it on Visual Studio 2022. Maybe download it and try running MainWindow.xaml.cs
I'm still in the process of learning how I would go about turning software like this into a packaged executable/application file and further
improvement for uploading to GitHub and etc.

Honestly though, probably not worth the effort. Publicly available for the sake of being my first completed (small) project :)
